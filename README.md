## This project is discontinued, it is now [Session](https://app-session.com)

The goal of this website is to provide an easy an bloat-free access to places that allow you to practice outdoor sports.

The website is currently hosted on github and uses some google services to handle a form but I am planning on moving to a more autonomus solution ASAP.

# Currently supported sports

Cliff diving, Street workout

# Sports that will be supported in the future

climbing, skateboarding, surfing, parkour, children playgrounds, and others...

# Contribute

## For everyone

 Some google my maps with cliff diving spots already exist and the spots could be migrated on the website, you can add some (after verifying that they are not already listed on the website) by using the form on the website. Please try to add some info (description, pictures, videos) that you can find on the web as they are usually poorly documented.

 Here are some known links :

## For the ones who do some developpement

You can contribute to the website by doing whatever modification you want, and soon, to the app that will come with it.


## For the ones who like design and picture editing/creation

I beleive that the appearance of the website is really important as it gives the first image to the new visitors who don't know what we have to offer. So having a good design and nice images would be nice ! If any of you see some points that could be improved, don't hesitate to create a pull request or to contact me !
