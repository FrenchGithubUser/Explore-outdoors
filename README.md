The goal of this website is to provide an easy an bloat-free access to places that allow you to practice outdoor sports.

The website is currently hosted on github and uses some google services to handle a form but I am planning on moving to a more autonomus solution ASAP.

# Currently supported sports

Cliff diving

# Sports that will be supported in the future

Street workout, climbing, skateboarding, surfing, parkour, children playgrounds, and others...

# Contribute

## For everyone

 Some google my maps with cliff diving spots already exist and the spots could be migrated on the website, you can add some (after verifying that they are not already listed on the website) by using the form on the website. Please try to add some info (description, pictures, videos) that you can find on the web as they are usually poorly documented.
