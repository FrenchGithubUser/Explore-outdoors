		<h2>The goals of the website</h2>

		<p class="justified">I always loved sports, going outside and explore whatever place I come accross. It started with
			calisthenics; if you have access to some pullup bars/dip bars/rings etc, the practice of this sport is made nicer
			and that is why knowing the places where you can find some is great. So some people made (or paid others to make)
			websites/apps with the goal of creating a publc database with all of these spots. These projects are great, I used
			them a lot and I am sure that it helped many others as well. However, they all include either ads, or trackers, or
			poor designs; they sometimes also are difficult to use (unstable, non intuitive) or unmaintained or not available
			on all devices. And that is why the project of this website is born. Here are the goals I have with it :</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Gathering spots for the practice of outdoors sports in an intuitive way</li>
			<li>Providing a lightweight website for use on any device and to encourage building a cleaner web</li>
			<li>Making it open source to allow people to modify it the way they want and to prevent it from being unmaintained
			</li>
			<li>Centralizing the spots of many sports for an easy access while keeping the community at its core</li>
			<li>Refuse the use of ads and trackers (<a href="#ads">see why</a>)
			<li>Showing to the people the beauty of the nature and the opportunity it gives us</li>
			<li>Sensibilize others about keeping the nature clean of waste</li>
			<li>Providing people with simple ressources about how to stay as safe as possible during the practice of these
				sports</li>
		</ul>



		<h2 id="cliff">The case of cliff diving</h2>

		<p class="justified">I received a lot of comments about how bad it is to gather cliff diving spots, and I understand
			all of the arguments. However, if I don't do it, someone else will (and <a href="https://www.bigswings.com/"
				target="_blank">already</a> did). I am aware that some places have been made destroyed by some people littering
			them, or closed due to accidents. That is why I try to encourage people to keep the spots clean and to jump
			safely. This is at the core of my project which doesn't seem to be the case for other similar ones. So I know that
			keeeping these locations more secret would be a better option, but that is not going to happen. I think that
			educating others is a more durable and better option.<br>If you have ideas about how I could do that in a better
			way, do not hesitate to get in touch with me (my contact is available in the footer of this page).</p>

		<h2 id="ads">Why we need to avoid ads</h2>

		<p class="justified">They allow web developpers to generate an income out of their customer's time and attention,
			but they also allow to bloat the web... Not everything is wrong about ads, but (to this date) I beleive that we
			should avoid them for the following reasons : </p>
		<ul>
			<li>they increase loading times</li>
			<li>they make websites ugly</li>
			<li>they take your time and attention away for money</li>
			<li>they encourage useless consumptions</li>
			<li>they are heavy on devices and severs (so more electricity consumption and very often bad for the environement)
			</li>
			<li>they rely on tracking and mass data collection</li>
		</ul>
		<p class="justified">I do not want to make generalities but this is the case for most ads, if not all. This list is
			not complete but they contain the main reasons why (in my opinion) ads should be avoided.<br>So how are
			developpers going to earn money ? Well, I have two main solutions in mind : donations and sponsors (they behave a
			lot differently than regular ads). If you like the content you are consuming, would you be against donating
			something like 50 cents a month instead of watching ads and getting the web polluted ? If more and more
			developpers take that path, more alternatives will be found anyways.</p>
