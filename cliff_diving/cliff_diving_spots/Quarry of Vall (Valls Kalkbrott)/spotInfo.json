		"d":"An old limestone quarry, and as such, the water has a beautiful green-cyan tone to it! Located in the middle of a pine forest, it's a magical place! Across the road is a natural lake as well, and a fireplace nearby one of the parking areas.    Mined as a deep ravine, Vall's Kalkbrott offers varying heights on both sides, easily swam across and is at some spots it's as deep as 50m (165ft). In the middle of the quarry there is a island with 3-5 meter cliffs, and easily accessible on the opposite side, there are rope swings and up to 6 meter cliffs.    Further down the length of the quarry a giant ravine towers through the water, and offers 16 meter ledges on the main side, and up to 18 meters on the off-side.    To get to the main parking area, follow the road between the lakes until it ends/narrows and turn right.",
