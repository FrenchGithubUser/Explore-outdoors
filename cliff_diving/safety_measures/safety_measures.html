    <p>Cliff diving is an amazing sport that allows you to go over some fears and discover overwhelming sensations <br>
    However, it can be extremely dangerous if the necessary precautions are not taken. This page will guide you through the necessary steps to help you avoid getting injured.</p>

    <div class="sectionTitle">1 - Check the depth <img src="scuba.svg" class="logo" width="7%"></div>

    <p>
      This is one of the most important rules, check how deep the water is before jumping into it.<br>
      Even if you know the spot, the water levels can change and stuff moves under the water as well ! And of course if you don't know the spot you should do that as well.<br>
      Grab a mask and explore the water, make sure it is at least 3 to 4 meters deep if you're planning on jumping from less than 10m, further heights require at least 5m of water.<br>
    </p>

    <div class="sectionTitle">2 - Go upwards gradually <img src="snail.svg" class="logo" width="8%"></div>

    <p>
      Going higher and higher can be very exciting but as you increase the height, you also increase the risks. You may want to do the same as your favorite cliff jumper that you saw on youtube the other day, but it's not that easy, they don't always show it but they have a strong training background and that is why they are able to do that.<br>
      As you are climbing up, the impact when entering the water gets harder and harder. You may not notice anything under 10m, but it comes quickly. This leads us to the next point.
    </p>

    <div class="sectionTitle">3 - Never jump alone <img src="alone.svg" class="logo" width="6%"></div>

    <p>
      It is easy to end up in a situation that you didn't think about and being with other people is necessary. You can always slip on a wet rock, step on an unstable rock or do a flat landing. The best option is to have at least two people in the water waiting for you in case something wrong happens.  <a href="https://youtu.be/eMvgCbXS2Cw">Professionnals are not immune either</a>.<br>
      If you watch videos of experienced cliff divers, you will always see their friends waiting for them at the bottom, and this not something to ignore.
    </p>

    <div class="sectionTitle">4 - Condition your body <img src="bicep.svg" class="logo" width="6%"></div>

    <p>
      If you are planning on jumping from high rocks, you definitely need a strong body to absorb the impact. Cliff jumpers participating at the <a href="https://www.redbull.com/int-en/event-series/redbull-cliffdiving">redbull cliff diving</a>  competitions are entering the water at nearly 80km/h and have to go back to 0 in 4.5m; that is very tough.<br>
      You can train yourself with bodyweight exercises very easily and with no special tools required.
    </p>

    <div class="sectionTitle">Conclusion</div>

    <p>
      The goal of this is not to scare you but rather to encourage you of jumping with the potential risks in mind. You can drastically lower the risks but they will always be there. Also, keep in mind that this goes the same with everything in life, driving a car is considered as a normal activity nowadays but it can also be very dangerous, just be aware of what can happen and do the possible to avoid the bad !<br>
      <p class="center">"It is always better to prevent than to cure"</p>
      I wish you some safe but great cliff diving sessions !
