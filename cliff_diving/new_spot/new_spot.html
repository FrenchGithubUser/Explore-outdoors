    <p>You can add a spot that is not referenced yet on the map by different ways :</p>

    <div class="maxWidthContainer">

      <p class="options">Option 1 (fast & easy) :</p>

      <div>
        <p>The fast and easy way is by using <a href="./form.html">this form</a>. You won't need any account to add it.<br>It sends your input into a google spreasheet which I use to update the OSM database everyday.</p>
      </div>

      <div style="margin-top:30px;"></div>

      <p class="options">Option 2 :</p>

      <p>The website is relying on the OSM database of markers with the tag "cliff_diving", so you can contribute directly on OSM and your spot will appear as soon as I will have pulled the new spots from their database (the map is showing the spots from a file that is generated once a day from the OSM database).</p>

      <div style="margin-top:15px;"></div>

      <p>Here is an example of the tags you can add :</p>



      <p>If you add other tags, they won't be shown on this website, unless you make a pull request on github with the necessary changes or ask me to do the modifications to the code of the website.</p>
